      <p>
        Welcome! My name is Paul Chastain and I am the founder and owner of
        Chastain Guitars. I have always been fascinated by guitar players and I
        have played the guitar for many years, which is what motivated me to
        create this company! My goal with the company is to show and sell some
        of my favourite guitars to people who would like to have a high quality
        guitar. If you need help with the hardware, you can always check out the
        hardware guide that I made because a lot of guitar players actually
        don't know what to look for when they're buying a new guitar, and I know
        how annoying it can be to find information on the internet.
